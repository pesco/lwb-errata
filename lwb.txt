** Spelling, Misprints, Editorial Mistakes **

LWB1	p. 15	Advanced Education Table, row 3: Electronics skill spelled
		"Electronic" in all columns.
LWB1	p. 26	Paragraph "Second Term": "Table 2, roll 4= gun combat" should
		be roll 6. [CotI, Axe 2019]
LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Fourth Term": "Table 2, roll 4= gun combat" should
		be roll 6. [CotI, Axe 2019]
LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Mustering Out": "benefits table, roll 6 (+1=6)= +1
		education" should be roll 2 (+1 = education).
LWB1	p. 36	Section "Weight", paragraph "Normal Load": "his or her
		strength [characteristic]" (singular).
LWB1	p. 40	Sentence "Most submachineguns are equipped..." is duplicated
		above "Laser Carbine".
LWB1	p. 41	Paragraph "Shoulder Stocks": "and some greater accuracy at
		longer [ranges]".

LWB2	p. 6	Paragraph "Misjump": DM for "within 10 planetary diameters"
		should be 10 (not 15) - cf. malfunctions table, p. 11.
LWB2	p. 14	Third paragraph: "the computer model (...) indicates the
		credit [value]..."
LWB2	p. 20	Second paragraph: "and steward (..." misses closing bracket.
LWB2	p. 26	Section "Basic Parameters", point "2. Space": extraneous
		period at end of second to last line (after "show").
LWB2	p. 29	Last line: "During the [ordnance] launch phase".
LWB2	p. 30	Ship's Data Card Example: "T-1 (B,M) Gunnery-1" (not Gunner).
LWB2	p. 37	Paragraph "Formulae": "information needed for [producing]".
LWB2	p. 48	First line: "by 5)" duplicated from p. 46.


** Errors, Inconsistencies **

LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Mustering Out": Jamison receives three extra rolls
		by virtue of his rank (5), not two.
LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Mustering Out" and next paragraph: Jamison cannot
		receive middle passage, as no such entry exists in the
		Merchants column of the benefits table. Also affects credit
		balance in his UPP.
LWB1	p. 41	Paragraph "Armor and Protection": "The weight of personal
		armor ... is not affected by the weight rule." - except for
		vacc suits. [CotI, Axe 2017]
LWB1	p. 42	Paragraph "Drawing", last sentence: "... for the purpose of a
		first shot." - could also be a swing.

LWB2	p. 27	Second paragraph "To prepare a data card": The order of "2)
		power plant..." and "3) J-drive..." is reversed with respect
		to the example (p. 30).
LWB2	p. 27	Second paragraph "To prepare a data card": Instructions state
		to list M-drive and J-drive letters. The example (p. 30) also
		shows acceleration and jump range.
LWB2	p. 48	Last paragraph: "Some goods (... and 66 on the table) are sold
		individually" - contradicts the statement on p. 47 (bottom):
		"Items ... through 66 are expressed in tons".


** In Need of Clarification **

LWB1	p. 33	Section "Combat Resolution": "A series of throws, in which
		each participating individual capable of making a combat throw
		makes one, is called a combat round". Does every individual
		have to attack if they can? (Presume no.)
		Suggestion: "... in which each individual capable of doing so is
		allowed to make a combat throw, ..."
LWB1	p. 34	It is very hard to tell directly from the text who or what
		determines the particular characteristic that a regular (i.e.
		not "first blood") wound should be applied to. (Presume
		defender's choice.)
LWB1	p. 34	The words "wound", "wounds", "hits", and "points" are used
		without clear definition, making it hard to tell from the text 
		that "the first wound received" refers to (presume) the sum
		total of damage thrown.
LWB1	p. 34	"As a result, first blood may immediately incapacitate or even
		kill": The sentence confusingly seems to imply that somehow
		otherwise the wound could not incapacitate or kill.
		Suggestion: Replace "immediately" with "easily".
LWB1	p. 34	"Once a characteristic has been reduced to zero, further
		points...": The text does not make it clear how to determine
		the next characteristic that "overflow" damage should apply
		to. (Presume the same way as the first.)
		Suggestion: "... further points must be applied to other
		characteristics determined in the same way." Move the sentence
		to the beginning of the paragraph to bring it closer to the
		mentions of how to determine the affected characteristic.
LWB1	p. 34	"Round fractions against the character" (presume down):
		Replace with "Round fractions down"? NB: LWB p. 155 states
		"round down" (only) in the context characters who never go
		unconscious.
LWB1	p. 36	Section "Morale": "+1 if the party is a military unit". Does
		this mean a unit in active military service? Can a "party of
		adventurers" (first sentence) be such a military unit? If not,
		should "of adventurers" be removed from the first sentence?
LWB1	p. 36	Section "Morale": "-2 if the leader is killed". Does this
		modifier apply only when killed or also when unconscious?
		While the wording is clear in itself, brevity, surrounding
		mentions of "casualties (unconscious or dead)", and the
		following questions confuse it.
		(a) Do "leader present" bonuses still apply when the leader is
		unconscious? (Presume no.)
		(b) Do bonuses of a new leader apply immediately (in the same
		round)? (Presume yes.)
		(c) Does killing an unconscious leader who has already been
		replaced still incur -2 and if so for how long? (Presume no.)
		Suggestion: "+1 if [any] leader (leader skill) is present [and
		conscious]; ...; -2 if the [current] leader is killed (...)"
LWB1	p. 42	Paragraph "Drawing", last sentence: "... achieves surprise..."
		- make clear that this means essentially an extra attack?

LWB2	p. 14	Fourth paragraph about bis models: "treated as the next higher
		level for jump support, but as the next lower level for
		software selection". On its own, "next lower level" could be
		misunderstood to mean one level lower numerically.
		Suggestion: "but as the [base] level for software..."
LWB2	p. 31	Game Turn Sequence, Native Player Turn: This section is word
		for word identical to Intruder Player Turn with only the roles
		reversed. This is not obvious since the text only defers to
		the table (p. 26 bottom).
		Suggestion: Add one sentence below "Native Player Turn" and
		remove phase descriptions (retain letters and phase names):
		"Same as intruder turn with the roles reversed.
		A. Native Movement.
		B. Native Laser Fire.
		...
		E. Native Computer Reprogramming."
LWB2	p. 36	Last paragraph: Point out that the sample planetary template
		is not at the standard scale as described?
		Suggestion: "... page 37 shows, at reduced size, Terra..."
LWB2	p. 39	Maneuver/evade: The wording "take the fraction of pilot skill
		and drop any fractions" is confusing. Take which fraction and
		drop it along with all others?
		Suggestion: "take the indicated fraction of pilot skill and
		round down".
LWB2	p. 39	Auto/evade: It is unclear how exactly A/e is "similar" to M/e
		and what "at a lower level" means. Is it similar in that it
		allows maneuvering, i.e. acceleration during the movment
		phase? (Presume no.) Can it be used without the maneuver
		program? (Presume yes.) Or does the wording "use of the
		maneuver drive as required" under M/e mean to imply that
		evasion requires the M-drive and therefore Maneuver?
		Suggestion: Switch the order of paragraphs, explaining
		Auto/evade first and Maneuver/evade as an extension of it.
		"Auto/evade is a program which automatically produces minor
		movement for a ship (independent of the maneuver program),
		thus reducing the chances of the ship being hit by laser fire;
		it allows a defensive DM against laser fire of -2.
		Maneuver/evade is a series of six programs that are similar to
		auto/evade, but perform at a higher level. Each has a DM based
		on pilot expertise (take the indicated fraction of pilot skill
		and round down). In addition, these programs allow normal use
		of the maneuver drive, in lieu of the maneuver program."


** Status Uncertain **

LWB1	p. 11	The Other career should get two skills per term just like
		Scouts. [CotI, daryen 2021]
LWB1	p. 14	The cash table includes entries for a roll of 7 for the Navy,
		Scout, and Merchant careers, even though such a roll is not
		possible (these careers cannot yield Gambling expertise).
LWB1	p. 15	Service Skills Table, Army career: Should "Air/Raft" be Grav
		Vehicle? Cf. pp. 17, 22, LWB p. 154.
LWB1	p. 15	Both education tables are titled "Advanced Education Table".
		Consider text on p. 10 (second to last paragraph): "The fourth
		is available only through advanced education". Should only the
		fourth table be called "Advanced"?
LWB1	p. 17	Should "Air/Raft" skill be Grav Vehicle? Cf. p. 22, LWB p. 154.
LWB1	p. 18	Should "ATV" skill be Wheeled Vehicle? Cf. p. 22, LWB p. 154.
