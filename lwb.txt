** Spelling, Misprints, Editorial Mistakes **

LWB1	p. 15	Advanced Education Table, row 3: Electronics skill spelled
		"Electronic" in all columns.
LWB1	p. 26	Paragraph "Second Term": "Table 2, roll 4= gun combat" should
		be roll 6. [CotI, Axe 2019]
LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Fourth Term": "Table 2, roll 4= gun combat" should
		be roll 6. [CotI, Axe 2019]
LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Mustering Out": "benefits table, roll 6 (+1=6)= +1
		education" should be roll 2 (+1 = education).
LWB1	p. 36	Section "Weight", paragraph "Normal Load": "his or her
		strength [characteristic]" (singular).
LWB1	p. 40	Sentence "Most submachineguns are equipped..." is duplicated
		above "Laser Carbine".
LWB1	p. 41	Paragraph "Shoulder Stocks": "and some greater accuracy at
		longer [ranges]".


** Errors, Inconsistencies **

LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Mustering Out": Jamison receives three extra rolls
		by virtue of his rank (5), not two.
LWB1	p. 27	Paragraph "Mustering Out" and next paragraph: Jamison cannot
		receive middle passage, as no such entry exists in the
		Merchants column of the benefits table. Also affects credit
		balance in his UPP.
LWB1	p. 41	Paragraph "Armor and Protection": "The weight of personal
		armor ... is not affected by the weight rule." - except for
		vacc suits. [CotI, Axe 2017]
LWB1	p. 42	Paragraph "Drawing", last sentence: "... for the purpose of a
		first shot." - could also be a swing.


** In Need of Clarification **

LWB1	p. 33	Section "Combat Resolution": "A series of throws, in which
		each participating individual capable of making a combat throw
		makes one, is called a combat round". Does every individual
		have to attack if they can?
LWB1	p. 34	It is very hard to tell directly from the text who or what
		determines the particular characteristic that a regular (i.e.
		not "first blood") wound should be applied to.
LWB1	p. 34	The words "wound", "wounds", "hits", and "points" are used
		without clear definition, making it hard to tell from the text 
		that "the first wound received" refers to the sum total of the
		damage throws.
LWB1	p. 34	"As a result, first blood may immediately incapacitate or even
		kill": This sentence seems to imply that a regular wound could
		for some reason not immediately incapacitate or kill, making
		the section more confusing. Replace "immediately" with
		"easily"?
LWB1	p. 34	"Once a characteristic has been reduced to zero, further
		points may not be applied to it...": The text does not make it
		clear how to determine the next characteristic that "overflow"
		damage should apply to.
LWB1	p. 34	"Round fractions against the character": Would it be better to
		just state "Round fractions down"? NB: LWB p. 155 states
		"round down" (only) in the context of wounded but conscious
		characters.
LWB1	p. 42	Paragraph "Drawing", last sentence: "... achieves surprise..."
		- make clear that this means essentially an extra attack?


** Status Uncertain **

LWB1	p. 11	The Other career should get two skills per term just like
		Scouts. [CotI, daryen 2021]
LWB1	p. 14	The cash table includes entries for a roll of 7 for the Navy,
		Scout, and Merchant careers, even though such a roll is not
		possible (these careers cannot yield Gambling expertise).
LWB1	p. 15	Service Skills Table, Army career: Should "Air/Raft" be Grav
		Vehicle? Cf. pp. 17, 22, 154.
LWB1	p. 15	Both education tables are titled "Advanced Education Table".
		Consider text on p. 10 (second to last paragraph): "The fourth
		is available only through advanced education". Should only the
		fourth table be called "Advanced"?
LWB1	p. 17	Should "Air/Raft" skill be Grav Vehicle? Cf. pp. 22, 154.
LWB1	p. 18	Should "ATV" skill be Wheeled Vehicle?
LWB1	p. 36	Section "Morale": "-2 if the leader is killed". Does this
		modifier apply only when killed or also when unconscious?
